# Current Progress – Transfer Credit Match React Frontend

Log of changes and progress for teammates. Intended to be committed and pushed with the repo as development continues.

### Full-stack auth and API wiring (session)

**Frontend**
- Shared API helpers in `src/lib/api.ts`: `apiUrl` (relative `/api` in dev vs optional `VITE_API_BASE` in production), Basic auth header builder, `getJson` / `postJson` / `postJsonText`, `ApiError`, and `parseRoleFromLoginMessage` for Spring plain-text login success messages.
- Vite dev proxy: `/api` → `http://localhost:8080` (`vite.config.ts`).
- `LoginPage` posts to `/api/auth/login`, derives role from the response, updates `RoleViewContext` (login state and credentials for secured calls), routes directors/admins to `/dashboard` and students to `/`.

**Backend (Spring)**
- Security and CORS configuration aligned with the SPA: public `/api/auth/**`, role-based access on other `/api/**` routes, JDBC authentication against the `users` table.

**Repo / delivery**
- Changes prepared to push to `origin` and the class preview repository (`ru-transfer-site-preview-2026`).

### Site skeleton

- **Layout:** Single layout route with `AppLayout` wrapping all pages (placeholder `<nav>`, `<Outlet />`, `<footer>`). No real Navbar or Footer components yet.
- **Routes:** All page routes in place: `/` (Landing), `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/match`, `/institutions`, `/programs`, `/about`. Each route renders a placeholder page component (e.g. `<h1>LandingPage</h1>`).
- **Stack:** Vite, React 18, TypeScript, React Router 7. Entry in `main.tsx` with `BrowserRouter`; route definitions in `App.tsx`.
- **Folders:** `src/pages/`, `src/components/layout/`, `src/components/shared/` (and placeholders for `services/`, `types/`). Skeleton is the base for Sprint 2 (real Navbar/Footer) and later sprints.

### About page and Spring 2026 Logs

  - **current-progress.md** – This file; dated changelog for frontend progress.
- **No push.** Changes are local only; ready for commit when the team is ready.

### Current sprint position

- **Sprint 1:** ✅ Complete (project setup, routing).
- **Sprint 2:** In progress (global layout + navigation; Navbar/Footer not yet implemented).
- **Sprint 3–7:** Not started.

---

### Scope and push strategy (same day)

- **Spring 2026 Logs** and all frontend docs moved inside `frontend-react/`. Only `frontend-react/` (including its docs and logs) is committed and pushed; nothing outside that folder is in scope for the frontend team.
- **docs-local/** at repo root is for personal notes and Cursor agent use only; it is not pushed.

### First push to origin

- **frontend-react pushed to `dev`.** Initial commit (`frontend: add React app with routing and Spring 2026 Logs`) added the full React app: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript, React Router with all page routes (Landing, Login, Register, Dashboard, Match, Institutions, Programs, About), AppLayout placeholder, and Spring 2026 Logs (page-mappings.md, current-progress.md).
- **Push scope confirmed.** Only `frontend-react/` is committed and pushed. Architecture, sprint plan, legacy mapping, and team-collaboration docs live in `docs-local/` (not pushed); only Spring 2026 Logs are pushed with the app.
